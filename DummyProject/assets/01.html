      <h2>Equity Futures Intraday Tips</h2>
         <p>This product is designed for Aggressive Clients seeking to do Intraday trades in the Futures segment for 1-3% gains. This product is suitable for professional Day Traders who are well versed with the Futures segment. The Futures Segment offers tremendous liquidity compared to the Cash segment as 90% of the market volumes take place in the Futures segment. To put it simply it&rsquo;s easier to buy 10000 shares of reliance in the Futures segment rather than in the Cash segment. A FREE TRIAL of two days is given so that Traders can verify the facts for themselves. We strongly recommend to purchase our 15 day subscription pack at a nominal cost it&rsquo;s difficult to measure the real success rate with a Two Days trial pack.</p>

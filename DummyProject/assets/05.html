         <h2>Equity BTST Tips</h2>
         <p>Equity BTST Tips are designed for traders who wish to profit from the moves of the last 45 minutes of trades and the opening moves of the next day. The last 45 minutes and the first 45 minutes are generally the most active periods of activity in the markets. Our Equity BTST Tips are structured to profit from these active phases in the markets.</p>
<p>This product is designed for Aggressive Clients seeking to do Quick trades in the Cash segment for 1-3 % gains. This product is suitable for Traders seeking to do trades only in the Cash Equity Segment and hence it&rsquo;s a long only product as short positions cannot be carried forward in the cash segment. Our Equity BTST Tips start getting generated from 2.45 pm onwards. We also look to take profits as far as possible on the same day itself.</p>
<p><strong>Traders desirous of getting both BTST and STBT calls can purchase our BTST/STBT Tips product but it&rsquo;s a product where we recommend only Futures.</strong></p>
<p>A FREE TRIAL of two days is given so that Traders can verify the facts for themselves. We strongly recommend to purchase our 15 day subscription pack at a nominal cost it&rsquo;s difficult to measure the real success rate with a Two Days trial pack.</p>
